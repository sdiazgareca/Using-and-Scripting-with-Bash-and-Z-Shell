# Module Summary: Listing Files and Directories

## Summary
This module provides foundational knowledge for navigating and managing files in UNIX-like systems using Bash and Z Shell. It introduces the file system structure, types of files, file listing with `ls`, advanced pattern matching through globbing, and file search with `find` and recursive globbing. Emphasis is placed on understanding shell expansion behavior and customizing shell behavior for better navigation.

## Key Concepts Explained
### UNIX Filesystem Overview
Covers basic directory structure in UNIX-like systems, including root (`/`), `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, and navigation using `cd`, `pwd`, and path types (absolute vs relative). Describes differences in Bash and Z Shell directory navigation and custom behavior with `setopt` in Z Shell.

### Types of Files
Explains file types in UNIX systems: regular files, directories, executable files, links, device files (character and block), sockets, and pipes (FIFOs).

### Listing Files with ls
Introduces the `ls` command with options like `-l`, `-h`, `-a`, `-t`, `-S`, and `-r` to list files with details such as size, modification date, and hidden files.

### Globbing and Pattern Matching
Explains wildcard-based file selection using patterns like `*`, `?`, `[A-Z]`, `{}` and glob qualifiers in Z Shell. Includes examples of extensions, ranges, and pattern-based matching.

### Locating Files
Demonstrates recursive file search with `find` and recursive globbing in Z Shell (`**/pattern`). Highlights use of quotes to prevent shell expansion and logical operators in `find` like `-o`.

## Commands and Code Examples

```bash
# Navigating directories
cd /bin          # Go to /bin directory
cd               # Return to home directory
cd -             # Go to previous directory
pwd              # Print working directory

# Listing files
ls               # Basic list
ls -l            # Long listing with permissions, size, date
ls -lh           # Human-readable sizes
ls -a            # Show hidden files
ls -t            # Sort by modification time
ls -S            # Sort by size
ls -r            # Reverse order

# Globbing examples
ls D*            # Files starting with D
ls *.jpg         # JPG files
ls *.*           # Files with an extension
ls ???.txt       # Files with three-letter names and .txt
ls [A-Ea-c]*     # Files starting with A-E or a-c
ls [^A-E]*       # Files NOT starting with A-E

# Extended globbing (Bash)
shopt -s extglob
ls @(*.jpg|*.png)

# Z Shell glob qualifiers
ls *(.)          # Regular files only
ls *(/)          # Directories only
ls *(*)          # Executables only
ls *(@)          # Symbolic links
ls *(Lk+2)       # Files larger than 2KB

# Locating files
find ~ -name grades2020.csv
find ~ -type d -name "grade*"
find ~ \( -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.mp4" \)

# Recursive globbing (Zsh)
ls **/*.mp4
```
## Complementary Knowledge

- The root directory `/` is the starting point of all absolute paths.
- Bash uses tab completion for directory navigation; Z Shell enhances this with interactive selection.
- In Z Shell, `setopt auto_cd` allows changing directories without `cd`.
- Always quote glob patterns when using `find` to prevent premature shell expansion.
- File extensions are not enforced by UNIX â€” use `file` to determine content type.
## Practice Lab

### Exercise 1
**Task**: Navigate to the `/etc` directory and print its absolute path.  
**Command**:
```bash
cd /etc && pwd
```
**Explanation**: Changes to `/etc` and confirms the current path with `pwd`.

### Exercise 2
**Task**: List all hidden files in your home directory in long format.  
**Command**:
```bash
ls -la ~
```
**Explanation**: `-a` includes hidden files, `-l` shows details.

### Exercise 3
**Task**: Show all `.jpg` and `.mp4` files in your home directory tree.  
**Command**:
```bash
find ~ \( -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.mp4" \)
```
**Explanation**: Uses `find` with logical OR to locate multiple file types.

### Exercise 4
**Task**: Use globbing to show all files with three-letter names ending in `.sh`.  
**Command**:
```bash
ls ???.sh
```
**Explanation**: Each `?` matches a single character.

### Exercise 5
**Task**: In Z Shell, list only the regular files greater than 1KB in current directory.  
**Command**:
```bash
ls *(.Lk+1)
```
**Explanation**: `.` restricts to regular files, `Lk+1` filters by size >1KB.
